                For the interactive version of the software, the software does not monitor anything on someone’s computer when they’re on a break or when they’re not working. So even people working from home can be comfortable knowing that they are not being monitored during their own time. Our position on privacy is that a company has the right to know what employees are doing during work hours, and have no right at all to know what they’re doing during breaks or after working.

                Myproject-desk tracks the websites and applications used while people are working. Managers can receive a report with this information. Managers can also receive a report listing potentially “poor-time-use” websites such as Facebook, and how long they were used.<br>

                Myproject-desk can also take screenshots of your employees’ computers while they’re working (this is an optional feature). The process of reviewing these screenshots is extremely quick for a management or HR person. The software also tracks keyboard & mouse activity so you’ll know if people are using their computers when they say they are.<br>

                Absolutely. About 20% of the benefits of the software come from the monitoring features. The other 80% come from empowering your staff to manage their own time more effectively, and from providing you with higher-level insights into how time is spent in your organization. These insights will enable to you improve processes in your business so that it runs more efficiently.<br>

For example one major benefit is the ability to know not only which specific tasks your employees are working on, but also how much time is being spent on which projects/clients across your company. This allows for better future allocation of time, improves communication with your team, reduces the time spent in unnecessary meetings and a host of other benefits.

              <div class="accordion-body">
                There are several reasons why Myproject-desk is effective at tracking time accurately and other applications are not:
<ol>
<li>
               <strong> Myproject-desk tracks time in REAL TIME –</strong> After you’ve finished working, it’s difficult to remember accurately how much time you spent on which tasks. With Myproject-desk, you don’t need to remember anything, because the time is tracked as you’re working.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>  Myproject-desk reminds you to track time –</strong> Other applications don’t have reminders, so users often forget to start tracking their time. Myproject-desk also reminds users to stop tracking their time if they visit website that may not be work related (like Facebook).
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>  Myproject-desk automatically stops tracking time when you leave the computer –</strong> If time tracking doesn’t automatically stop when you go on a break, you’ll often forget when your break began and your tracked hours won’t be accurate. Myproject-desk stops tracking work time when there’s been no keyboard or mouse activity for a while, and can give users the option to indicate afterwards whether or not they were working during that time.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>  Myproject-desk has multiple methods to confirm if the time tracked was real work –</strong> These methods include screenshots taken at regular intervals, levels of keyboard & mouse activity, and which websites & applications are used.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>  Myproject-desk does not allow you to “double book” your time –</strong> In other words when you allocate time to 1-3pm you can’t allocate a second activity to that same time slot. It seems incredible but most time tracking applications allow users to apply overlapping activities to the same time slot.
